# GraphDB-Neo4j

This repository contains a set of validated physical design strategies that optimize data search in graph-oriented databases. The proposed strategies are Query Rewriting, Path Materialization and Index Creation, which were implemented for the 25 queries of the SNB Business Interactive Workload group. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed physical design strategies were validated through experimentation.
